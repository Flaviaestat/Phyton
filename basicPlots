fifa_data = pd.read_csv(fifa_filepath, index_col="Date", parse_dates=True)

# fifa_filepath - The filepath for the dataset always needs to be provided first.
# index_col="Date" - When we load the dataset, we want each entry in the first column to denote a different row. To do this, we set the value of index_col to the name of the first column ("Date", found in cell A1 of the file when it's opened in Excel).
# parse_dates=True - This tells the notebook to understand the each row label as a date (as opposed to a number or other text with a different meaning).
